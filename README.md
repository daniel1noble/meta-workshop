# Introduction to Meta-Analysis in Comparative Physiology

This webpage hosts material for our meta-analysis workshop that will be run at Society of Experimental Biology (SEB) 2022 conference in Montpellier, France. 

The workshop is a team effort, run by [Daniel Noble](www.nobledan.com), Nicky Wu and Essie Rodgers. It is geared towards researchers interested in conducting a meta-analysis in comparative physiology. Having said that, all the principles learnt here apply to meta-analyses conducted in any research field.

Meta-analysis is a huge complex topic. We can only hope to touch the surface in a single morning workshop. Thi
