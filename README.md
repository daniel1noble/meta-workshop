# Introduction to Meta-Analysis in Comparative Physiology

This webpage hosts material for our meta-analysis workshop that will be run at Society of Experimental Biology (SEB) 2022 conference in Montpellier, France. 

The workshop is a team effort, run by [Daniel Noble](https://www.nobledan.com), [Nicky Wu](https://wunicholas.wixsite.com/home) and [Essie Rodgers](http://www.rodgerslab.com/the-team.html). It is geared towards researchers interested in conducting a meta-analysis in comparative physiology. Having said that, all the principles learnt here apply to meta-analyses conducted in any research field.

Meta-analysis is a huge, complex topic. We can only hope to touch the surface of how it's done in a single morning workshop. As such, we will not have time to cover a critical aspect of meta-analysis; the process of systematic searching. 

Systematic searches are important to comprehensive, transparent and reproducible meta-analyses. The question needs to be clearly defined, and systematic searches need to be well documented, carefully refined, have detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria so that they may be repeated in the future. [Foo *et al.* 2021](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13654) is an excellent resource for this stage of a meta-analysis. We also recommend following the PRISMA Eco-Evo protocol proposed by [O'Dea *et al.* 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12721).
