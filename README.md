# **Part 1**
**Introduction: Why do meta-analysis?**
- Quantitative synthesis that provides effect magnitude that can be used for: 
	1) power analyses, 
	2) predicting effects across space and time etc.
- Philosophical
	- One study is almost never enough (sampling theory) 
	- Studies in ecology and evolution are underpowered so provides a way to improve power.
- Heterogeneity. 
	- We can measure how variable an outcome is across studies 
	- Attempt to explain this variability 
	- Provide important new avenues for research and test critical hypotheses
	- Prediction intervals

**Effect sizes, what to use and when to use them, what they mean**
- Key characteristics of an effect size
- Comparability issues
- 'Nuisance heterogeneity' and how to deal with it?

**Meta-analytic models**
- Random effects and multi-level meta-analysis
- Meta-regression models
- Mostly need multilevel meta-analysis
	-Multi-level is important! Add obs in metafor
- Visualising
	- Funnel plots
	- Orchard plots
- Interpretation of and reporting from models

# **Part 2**
**Advanced Meta-analytic Topics**
- Publication bias
	- how to deal with it.
- Meta-analysis of magnitudes
	- Correctly analysing unsigned effect sizes
- Controlling for Non-independence 
	- Phylogeny
	- Shared control / shared trait
	- VCV matrices; phylogeny, shared control etc
	- Robust variance estimators when unknown.
- Missing standard deviations
- Arm-based meta-analysis
